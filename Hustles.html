 <h1> Hustles</h1>
 <p>What I consider to be Hustles are different ways to make money</p>
 <p>Currently I have ideas about making some of my hobbies into Hustles, I want to become a personal trainer everntually, or even a sponsered athlete. I'm also a musician and joining a band is another idea I want to try out.</p> 
 <p>Working as a bike messenger has taught me how to have a good work ethic, and always think fast. It's a fun way to make a living.</p>
