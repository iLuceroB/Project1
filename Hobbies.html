<h2>Cycling</h2>
<p>Growing up I realized quickly that I was not very good at traditional sports. My hand eye Coordination was pretty bad</p>
<p>During my last year of highschool I found cycling, first through just work then realized the subculture that exsists not only in Chicago but also all around the world</p>
<p>I've met lots of people through just riding and made some close friends</p>
<h3>Racing<h3>
<p>After a few years I found the opportunity to join a cycling team and race bikes amaturely</p>

I'm intereseted in Bodybuilding, boxing, cycling, and swimming.</p>
